## P1

- Force-downgrade of Hyper-V plugin to version 1.0.1 to attempt to resolve regression issue noted [here](https://github.com/hashicorp/packer-plugin-hyperv/issues/65)
- Check if this resolves issues - dowgrade packer to around 1.7.0 if not or wait for Plugin update to fix (or try downloading and editing manually if it's just a case of hidden network adaptors not showing as another issue seemed to suggest?)

## P2

- Test out QEMU Usage
- Variablise builds to trim templates (focus on Windows originally)
- Try get VirtualBox (amongst other providers) working for Linux-based images.

## P3

- Add more OSs (Fedora and Debian?)
- Add other Kali builds
