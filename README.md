## ToDos:

### P1
- Force- downgrade of Hyper-V plugin to version 1.0.1 to attempt to resolve regression issue noted [here](https://github.com/hashicorp/packer-plugin-hyperv/issues/65)

### P2
- Test out QEMU Usage
- Variablise builds to trim templates (focus on Windows originally)
- Try get VirtualBox (amongst other providers) working for Linux-based images.
